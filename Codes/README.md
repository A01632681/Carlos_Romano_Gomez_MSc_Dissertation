# Smart Glasses for Blind People based on a tensor decomposition algorithm: CODES

## Description

This folder contains all the codes necessary to record videos on the Zed Mini Camera using the Jetson as computer. The "CameraRecordingStoring" file contains the necessary code to record a video for a specific number of frames (45 by default) with a VGA resolution at 60 fps. It also asks if the file wants to be saved in a folder, where it will store the image, the depth image and the Point Cloud file.
This folder also contains another folder with tests codes from external sources, that were used as a guide to develop the model and the recording codes. 
Finally, there's also a test folder that contains dummy codes that were used to explore new ideas to implement in the project, such as the integration of simultaneous Audio and Video to the recording and storing.
